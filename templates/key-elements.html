<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
	<p class="question ExpandHeader">Why can't staff members of the school, county, or the care facility where the child lives be responsible for representing the child on educational matters?</p>
	<div class="ExpandItem">
	  <p>There are a number of reasons:</p>
	  <ul type="disc">
		  <li>Both the school and agency may have restrictions that conflict with meeting the child's individual needs </li>
		  <li>Neither the school nor the agency can act as a totally neutral party to advocate without conflict of interest </li>
	  </ul>
	</div>

<h3>Disability knowledge</h3>
	<p class="question ExpandHeader">How much does a surrogate parent need to know about the child's disability and where can this information be found?</p>
	<div class="ExpandItem">
	  <p>To be an effective surrogate parent, it is helpful to acquire some information about the child's disability. The child's teacher, many state and national organizations, and the local library may have helpful information. PACER Center has a resource list of disability organizations, see our <a href="/parent/links.asp">Recommended Organizations by Category</a> listing.</p>

  <p>To advocate effectively for your child (speak up on his or her behalf), and make good decisions about your childâ€™s education, you need to have important information from the school. School records, such as test scores, report cards, or behavior reports, all contain information for making educational decisions. Keeping track of school paperwork is an important part of parent involvement.</p>

  <h2>Top 10 facts that parents, educators and students should know</h2>
  <h3>1. The statistics &ndash; Students with disabilities are much more likely to be bullied than their nondisabled peers.</h3>
	  <p>Although only 10 U.S. studies have been conducted on the connection between bullying and developmental disabilities, all of these studies found that children <strong>with disabilities were two to three times more likely to be bullied than their nondisabled peers</strong>. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disabilities-Insights-Across-Fields-Around/dp/0313346046" target="_blank"><em>Disabilities: Insights from Across Fields and Around the World<strong>; </strong></em>Marshall, Kendall, Banks &amp; Gover (Eds.), 2009</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>)</p>
	  <p>One study shows that 60 percent of students with disabilities report being bullied regularly compared with 25 percent of all students. (Source: British Journal of Learning Support, 2008)</p>
	  <p>For more information, visit &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/about/media-kit/stats.asp">Bullying Statistics</a>.&rdquo;</p>
	<h3>2. The impact - Bullying affects a student&rsquo;s ability to learn.</h3>
	  <p>Many students with disabilities are already addressing challenges in the academic environment. When they are bullied, it can directly impact their education.</p>
	  <p>Bullying is not a harmless rite of childhood that everyone experiences. Research shows that bullying can negatively impact a child&rsquo;s access to education and lead to:</p>
	  <ul>
      <li>school avoidance and higher rates of absenteeism</li>
      <li>decrease in grades</li>
      <li>inability to concentrate</li>
      <li>loss of interest in academic achievement</li>
      <li>increase in dropout rates</li>
	  </ul>
	<h3>3. The definition &ndash; Bullying based on a student&rsquo;s disability may be considered harassment.</h3>
	  <p>The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have stated that bullying may also be <strong>considered harassment</strong> when it is based on a student&rsquo;s race, color, national origin, sex, <strong>disability</strong>, or religion.</p>
	  <p>Harassing behaviors may include:</p>
	  <ul>
      <li>unwelcome conduct such as verbal abuse, name calling, epithets, or slurs </li>
      <li>graphic or written statements </li>
      <li>threats </li>
      <li>physical assault </li>
      <li>other conduct that may be physically threatening, harmful, or humiliating </li>
	  </ul>
